# traininglogger
Basic exercise session logger

## Overview
This project was done as a prototype for my next project which is a weights training tracker application.

This was started from a desire to learn html, css, javascript, and general web technologies.

This project has resulted in a single page running in browser which can take input of a workout session (html/css/javascript)

There is a backend server (running locally, as is the frontend. neither are hosted remote) using node.js, express, and sqlite

Data is saved to the backend database. There is also an API to retrieve some data, though it hasn't been implemented on the actual frontend.


I may change this in future for experiments etc, but overall this has served it's purpose which was to introduce me to the above stack of technologies

in preperation for starting the 'real' project

## Original Spec
- Browser app to take input of exercises, sets, and reps. 

- Save that information to local storage.

- Allow retrieval and display of the stored data.

## Original Aims
- Further learning of html and css, particularly layout and input elements.

- Start learning Javascript.

- Produce a proof of concept for future Training tracker project.

## Further Aims
The above aims were succesfuly achieved: created a page to accept a workout session input & save to localstorage.
Further aims have been added to allow me to learn backend and database before starting main training tracker project
- Implement a local backend server using node.js & express
- Implement a database sqlite
- Implement backend logic and api endpoints to allow storage and retrieval of data
